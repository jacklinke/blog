Leadership—whether in the military or in a software company—isn't about titles, and it's definitely not about personal glory. If you want to build a strong, motivated team, there are three simple rules to live by:

* *Give credit where it's due.*
    
* *Take the blame when things go wrong.*
    
* *Fight for your people when they need you.*
    

These ideas aren't new, but they're worth repeating—because too many people who *should* be leaders fail to follow them.

## Give the Credit

Your team does the real work. A good leader recognizes this and ensures the right people get acknowledged.

> *Years ago, I worked for someone who would praise me privately for my work. But when I would build detailed, quality products or documents, that person would strip the email traffic and summarize the text as though the work originated solely from them. I can tell you that this was absolutely demoralizing. I didn't feel like I needed public acknowledgement for every task I accomplished, but seeing someone else accept the credit for my work was a huge discouragement from providing them with my best.*

When someone on your team has a great idea, *praise them publicly*. Whether it's in a team meeting, a company-wide email, or a casual conversation, give them the recognition they deserve. It costs you nothing, but means everything to them.

If they send you an email with an insightful solution or well-executed work, don't just summarize it as if you came up with it. Forward their email, add a note highlighting their contribution, and CC them so they can see the impact of their work. It's as easy as writing, "This was \[Name\]'s idea. They put in the hard work to make it happen."

Why does it matter? Because when people feel seen and valued, they invest more in their work. They're more willing to take risks, share ideas, and go the extra mile.

And as a leader, when you consistently credit your team, it doesn't diminish your reputation, it enhances it! Having talented people producing quality work under your leadership is a testament to your ability to develop others—a hallmark of real leadership.

## Take the Blame

*Good leaders take responsibility.*

As a leader, you're ultimately accountable for:

* How you train your team
    
* The processes you establish
    
* The culture you foster
    
* The guidance you provide (*or fail to provide*)
    

Nothing destroys trust faster than watching a leader throw their team under the bus when something goes wrong. We've all seen it before—some higher-up trying to save face by blaming an employee or a "communication failure." It might work in the short term, but the damage is lasting. Your people will never fully trust you again. And once you lose trust, you will never again have their full commitment or best work.

A real leader says, "That's on me. I should have caught that. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again."

Even if the mistake wasn't directly your fault, as the leader, it's your responsibility to own it.

### Why? Because it...

**Builds trust**—When your team sees you standing up for them, even in tough situations, they'll know you have their back. They'll feel safe taking calculated risks, which is critical for innovation and growth.

**Fosters accountability**—By modeling accountability, you encourage your team to take ownership of their work. They'll be more likely to admit their mistakes and learn from them, rather than hiding them out of fear.

**Protects your integrity**—Blaming others might save face in the short term, but it diminishes your character in the long term. Taking responsibility, on the other hand, shows strength and humility.

It doesn't mean you ignore mistakes. You still need to address what went wrong, but that happens privately, within your team—not in a public blame game. Your job is to absorb the hit so your people can keep doing good work without fear.

## Fight for Your People

> *Early in my military career, there was a pivotal moment where I failed to do this. In order to achieve a goal that had not been accomplished in previous exercises, our unit leadership decided on a course of action that had our Marines working in the desert heat for the entire day, displacing & emplacing large, complex equipment in a single day. It was far too much. And I should have known and ensured my Marines were taken care of. Instead, I pushed them to work an unrealistic number of hours under the hot desert sun until the point that my most mechanical-minded Marine torqued a bolt beyond the intended 90 foot-pounds to 350 foot-pounds instead - shearing the bolt head and seizing the steel shaft of the bolt into the aluminum frame it was seated in. We had no spare frames. At that point I demanded all work cease for the day. Exercises are important for learning and improving, but not at the risk of personnel and equipment safety. I spent nearly 8 hours the next day slowly drilling that bolt out of the frame so we could reassemble the equipment. And I learned an important lesson. As the leader, I was the one who should have been aware of my Marines' fatigue and diminishing concentration, and I should have had the courage to tell leadership that the demands we had placed on them were unrealistic and unsafe. I felt ashamed, and vowed never to make a mistake like that again. And I think I have succeeded in that goal.*

Leadership isn't just about managing tasks—it's about protecting and advocating for your team. It's about caring for the people on your team as human beings.

A decade ago, a mentor of mine told me:

> "When you get a promotion, the money and benefits are for you. But the rank is for your team."

That stuck with me. Leadership comes with authority, but that authority is meant to be used *for* the people you lead. Your position isn't just a personal achievement—it's a platform to advocate for those you lead.

If someone from another department is causing problems for a member of your team, step in. If upper management is making unrealistic demands, push back. If your team member is being treated unfairly, be the shield between them and the nonsense.

> *I recently became aware that our organization had made errors in the accession records for someone on my team. Because I had recently done the research to resolve a similar situation with my own records, I knew exactly what to do to fix the issue. We sat together for a while and combed through their paperwork, eventually submitting the required forms to headquarters. It took very little time and effort on my part, but it gave that person peace in knowing that their records reflected the correct values, and it resulted in a substantial amount of back-pay for them. For several weeks afterwards, I was living off the high of being able to help them!*

When you use your position to:

* Shield your team from organizational politics
    
* Get them the resources they need
    
* Remove barriers to their success
    
* Stand up for them when they're treated unfairly
    
* Advocate for them when they are overworked or overlooked
    
* Provide growth opportunities, such as cross-training or certifications
    
* Demand that they get the awards and promotions they deserve
    

...you demonstrate that you value them as humans, not just resources. And you build a team that's willing to go the extra mile—not because they have to, but because they want to.

## The Leadership Paradox

Leadership isn't about the title on your door or your position on an org chart. It's about how you show up for the people who trust you with their time, talent, and ambition.

In a world where "leadership" is often equated with dominance, having "winning cards", or self-promotion, embracing these ideas can feel counter-cultural. But here's the paradox: the more credit you give away, the more you receive. The more responsibility you take for failures, the more authority you earn. The more you fight for others, the stronger your own position becomes.

You might worry that taking the blame will make you look weak or that giving away credit will diminish your own contributions. But in reality, these actions demonstrate confidence, humility, and a genuine concern for people—qualities that inspire loyalty and respect. When you give credit, take blame, and fight for your people, you create a culture of trust, accountability, and mutual respect. Your team will be more engaged, more productive, and more likely to stick around. And as their leader, their success reflects on you.

So, the next time your team achieves something great, make sure the right people get the credit. The next time something goes wrong, step up and own it. And the next time your team needs someone in their corner, be that person.

It's not just good leadership—it's the right thing to do.

## Putting These Ideas into Practice

If you're looking to implement these ideas in your leadership approach:

1. Start small—Begin by intentionally calling out one team member's contribution each week in a meeting, email, or during visits from senior personnel in the organization.
    
2. Create a "blame-free" environment—Establish a norm where mistakes are treated as learning opportunities, not just reasons for punishment.
    
3. Schedule regular one-on-ones—Use this time to understand your team members' challenges and identify where you can advocate for them. But also—just take some time to talk with your people! After all, you are also a person. It is okay to chat and interact with your team. You don't have to be "the boss" at all times.
    
4. Reflect regularly—*This is my biggest struggle, but one I have worked hard to improve on*. You can, too. Set a calendar reminder to ask yourself monthly: *"Who on my team has done great work that I can award or praise them for? Were there recent situations where I took responsibility (or failed to)? How have I fought for my team lately?"*
